Michael founded the CryptoCurrency Certification Consortium (C4), which is a not-for-profit organization dedicated to building and maintaining standards and certifications for the cryptocurrency industry. C4 collaborated with many leaders in the space to categorize the knowledge every bitcoin professional should have and drafted exam questions to accurately test for that knowledge. The result was a heavily peer-reviewed exam that allows anyone to earn a professional certification and become a Certified Bitcoin Professional (CBP).</p>

<p>Michael serves as a director of the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada, a non-profit organization that promotes, educates, and protects bitcoin in Canada.
